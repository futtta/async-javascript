Async Javascript lets you add 'async' or 'defer' attribute to scripts to exclude to help increase the performance of your WordPress website.

== Description ==
Eliminate Render-blocking Javascript in above-the-fold content with Async Javascript.

Render-blocking Javascript prevents above-the-fold content on your page from being rendered until the javascript has finished loading. This can impact on your page speed and ultimately your ranking within search engines. It can also impact your users experience.

Async JavaScript gives you full control of which scripts to add a 'async' or 'defer' attribute to or to exclude to help increase the performance of your WordPress website.

== Installation ==
Installation is very straightforward:

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Settings` > `Async JavaScript` menu to load settings page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Firefox 3.6 and higher
